            <h2>Symptons of COVID-19</h2>
            <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
               dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
               congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
               usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
               donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
               (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
               treatment.</p>

            <h2>How does COVID-19 spread</h2>
            <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
               disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
               the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
               coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
               around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching
               these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
               People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
               person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
               why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
               person who is sick.</p>
